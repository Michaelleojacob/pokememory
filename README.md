# How to use:<br>Click on the >Live application< above.<br>Once the app is open, there are instructions on the web-page itself.<br>In case you would rather read this README:<br>Click on any of the pokemon to begin playing the game.<br>Each time you click a unique pokemon, your score will increase.<br>If you click on a non unique pokemon (one you have already clicked on), the score and game will reset.<br>The max score you can get is 12.<br>If you manage to get 12 points, you win the game. There is no logic for a win, just click any pokemon to reset the game if you would like to play again.
